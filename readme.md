## PY32F0 series MCU datasheets, packs, reference manuals, etc.



see PY32F0 template project at [decaday/py32f0_cmake_template](https://github.com/decaday/py32f0_cmake_template)

#### Notice

Please note that the documentation for Puya Semiconductor is in a semi-public state, and I cannot guarantee the completeness and timeliness of the information. If you have updated or additional information, feel free to contribute.

#### About document language

Only the datasheet and some parts of the reference manual have English versions, and the English materials are all suffixed with `_EN`.

It seems that the English versions are also lagging behind the Chinese versions.
